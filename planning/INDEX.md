# pphi2 — remaining-axiom discharge plan (master index)

**Plan-loop status machine for the 17 project-introduced axioms** standing between the current
state and "φ⁴₂ is a Wightman QFT, in Lean." Single source of truth: this file. Each row points to
the canonical detailed discharge plan (in `docs/`); where the detailed plan is stale or missing,
that is flagged. Re-read this index every cycle; pick the next `todo`/`in_progress` item whose
`deps` are `done`.

Status legend: `done` = proved/sorry-free · `in_progress` = actively being formalized ·
`scoped` = discharge route designed, not started · `open` = route not yet pinned.
Difficulty: `★` mechanical/short · `★★` real but bounded · `★★★` genuine hard analytic core.

## The goal & geometry

T² (compact torus) already has **OS0–OS2**. The **cylinder** `ℝ × S¹_{Ls}` (infinite Euclidean
time) adds **OS3 (reflection positivity)** and **OS4 (clustering / mass gap)** — the gateway to
**OS reconstruction → Wightman QFT**. The two gating analytic estimates are **CYL-1a** (the
`Lt`-uniform exponential-moment bound, gating OS0/OS1) and **CYL-2a** (the uniform spectral gap →
clustering, gating OS4). Master campaign doc: [`docs/cylinder-master-plan.md`].

## Cluster 2 — CYL-2a: uniform spectral gap → clustering (gates OS4)

**Full plan: [`planning/cyl-2a-spectral-gap.md`].** Key findings there: (i) the two clustering
axioms **ride on the B2 trace bridge** — they reduce to the proved `connected_two_point_le`, so
they discharge in the same PR as B2 (★★ given that bridge); (ii) `spectral_gap_uniform/lower_bound`
as stated are **too strong** — φ⁴₂ has a phase transition where the gap closes, so they need a
weak-coupling / single-phase hypothesis.

- [ ] **17. `spectral_gap_uniform`** `TransferMatrix/SpectralGap.lean:89`   status: scoped   deps: []   diff: ★★★
  note: gap survives `a→0` (finite-`a` gap `asymGappedTransfer'` PROVED; continuum uniformity
  remains). **Regime-restricted** (phase transition). Route: `a→0` eigenvalue-gap limit /
  perturbative. THE independent hard core of CYL-2a. → `planning/cyl-2a-spectral-gap.md`.
- [ ] **16. `spectral_gap_lower_bound`** `TransferMatrix/SpectralGap.lean:100`   status: scoped   deps: []   diff: ★★★→★★
  note: `c·mass ≤ massGap` — FALSE at criticality; weak-coupling `m_phys ≥ m − Cλ` via the existing
  Nelson estimates. → `planning/cyl-2a-spectral-gap.md`.
- [ ] **14. `two_point_clustering_from_spectral_gap`** `OSProofs/OS4_MassGap.lean:137`   status: scoped   deps: [3-bridge]   diff: ★★ (given B2 trace bridge)
  note: = `connected_two_point_le` with `γ=e^{−massGap·a}` via `twoPoint_dictionary` +
  `asymTransferKernel_kPow_apply` (proved). Do in the B2 trace-bridge PR. → `planning/cyl-2a-spectral-gap.md`.

  note: same, bounded `F,G` → `M_F,M_G`. → `planning/cyl-2a-spectral-gap.md`.

## Cluster 3 — OS2 (rotation invariance)

- [ ] **13. `rotation_cf_defect_polylog_bound`** `OSProofs/OS2_WardIdentity.lean:614`   status: scoped   deps: []   diff: ★★★
  note: lattice breaks rotations; the characteristic-function rotation defect → 0 in the continuum
  limit (polylog bound). Plan: [`docs/cylinder-master-plan.md`], [`docs/dual-construction-strategy.md`].
- [ ] **5. `os2_from_phi4`** `Bridge.lean:345`   status: scoped   deps: [13]   diff: ★★
  note: OS2 (E(2)-invariance) for the φ⁴ measure from the rotation defect bound. Plan:
  [`docs/axiom_proof_plans.md`], [`docs/AXIOM_STATUS.md`].

## Cluster 4 — continuum-limit inheritance

- [ ] **6. `continuum_exponential_moment_bound`** `ContinuumLimit/AxiomInheritance.lean:123`   status: scoped   deps: [1]   diff: ★★
  note: pass the `Lt`-uniform exp-moment (1) to the continuum measure. Plan:
  [`docs/asym-interacting-expmoment-volume-uniform-discharge-plan.md`].
- [ ] **7. `canonical_continuumMeasure_cf_tendsto`** `ContinuumLimit/AxiomInheritance.lean:327`   status: scoped   deps: []   diff: ★★
  note: characteristic-function convergence lattice → continuum. Plan: [`docs/pr10_summary.md`].
- [ ] **8. `continuum_exponential_clustering`** `ContinuumLimit/AxiomInheritance.lean:354`   status: scoped   deps: [14, 15]   diff: ★★
  note: clustering passes to the continuum. Plan: [`docs/cyl-2-scope.md`].
- [ ] **10. `latticeGreenBilinear_basis_tendsto_continuum`** `GaussianContinuumLimit/PropagatorConvergence.lean:103`   status: scoped   deps: []   diff: ★★
  note: free propagator (bilinear form) lattice → continuum on a basis. Plan: [`docs/pr10_summary.md`].
  (Free/Gaussian — likely the most tractable here; cf. the proved `second_moment_asym_tendsto`.)

## Cluster 5 — non-triviality (the limit is genuinely interacting)

**Full plan: [`planning/non-triviality.md`].** The two are very different: 11 is *not*
non-Gaussianity (only `S₂>0`, ★★ via correlation inequalities, all phases); 9 is the genuine
interacting content (`u₄≠0`, ★★★, needs `λ>0`).

- [ ] **11. `pphi2_nontriviality`** (`S₂(f,f)>0` for `f≠0`) `Main.lean:128`   status: scoped   deps: []   diff: ★★
  note: limit ≠ δ₀. Free positivity `‖f‖²_{H⁻¹}>0` (have) + interacting ≥ free (Griffiths/FKG,
  partly built `Lattice/FKG.lean`) + limit. All phases. → `planning/non-triviality.md`.
- [ ] **9. `continuumLimit_nonGaussian`** (`S₄−3S₂²≠0`) `ContinuumLimit/Convergence.lean:256`   status: open   deps: [6]   diff: ★★★
  note: connected 4-pt (`u₄`) ≠ 0 — the proof the theory is interacting. Lebowitz 4-pt inequality +
  uniform strict lattice bound (`d=2` super-renormalizable ⟹ no cancellation) + moment convergence.
  Even `P`, `λ>0`. THE non-triviality mountain. → `planning/non-triviality.md`.

## Cluster 6 — OS→Schwinger bridge

- [ ] **4. `schwinger_agreement`** `Bridge.lean:274`   status: scoped   deps: []   diff: ★
  note: the constructed Schwinger functions agree with the measure moments (bookkeeping bridge).
  Plan: [`docs/axiom_proof_plans.md`], [`docs/AXIOM_STATUS.md`].

## Cluster 0 — foundational (feeds Layer A)

- [ ] **12. `nelson_exponential_estimate_master_bounded`** `NelsonEstimate/PolynomialChaosBridge.lean:1321`
  status: scoped   deps: []   diff: ★★★
  note: the Nelson hypercontractivity / polynomial-chaos exponential estimate — the analytic engine
  under Layer A. Plans: [`docs/nelson-bridge-generalization-plan.md`],

## The four genuine ★★★ mountains (mostly independent)

1. **The exp-moment chain** (1 ← 2 ← 12, + 3) — Layer A (Nelson/Lee–Yang) + Layer B2 (transfer gap,
   ours). Status: B2 mostly proved (HS trace-bridge tail); Layer A not started.
2. **The uniform spectral gap** (16, 17) — the OS4 mass gap surviving `a→0`. **Regime-restricted**
   (phase transition). *Independent of B2.* — Note: the **clustering** axioms (14, 15) are NOT a
   separate mountain; they ride on the B2 trace bridge (= `connected_two_point_le`).
3. **Non-Gaussianity** (9, `u₄≠0`) — the limit is genuinely interacting. *Needs `λ>0`.* — Note:
   `pphi2_nontriviality` (11, `S₂>0`) is only ★★, NOT a mountain.
4. **Rotation restoration** (13) for OS2 — the lattice→continuum rotation defect.

Everything else (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15) is ★/★★ "estimate-and-pass-to-limit" or rides on a
mountain's infrastructure once it lands.

## Staleness flags
Many `docs/*` plans predate the transfer-matrix pivot (several dated 2026-05-13). The CURRENT
status for Layer B2 (3) and the transfer route is `docs/B4B5-design.md` +
`docs/transfer-instantiation-plan.md` (refreshed 2026-06-04). `docs/AXIOM_STATUS.md` and
`docs/axiom_proof_plans.md` are the prior consolidation attempts — this index supersedes them as
the master status machine; refresh those or fold them in.
