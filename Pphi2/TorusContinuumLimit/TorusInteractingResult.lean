# The T² P(φ)₂ theory is interacting (weak coupling)

Assembles the headline `TorusIsInteracting` for the **genuine** torus continuum limit `μ`, in the
**weak-coupling regime** (large mass), from:
* `torusInteractingLimit_exists` — the limit exists (PROVED, axiom-clean);
* `torus_connectedFourPoint_tendsto` — `u₄(μ_N) → u₄(μ)` (PROVED step IV, axiom-clean);
* `torus_weakCoupling_lattice_connectedFourPoint_strictNeg` — the uniform strict lattice bound
  `u₄(μ_N) ≤ −c < 0` for `mass > m₀` (the one remaining analytic input, here an **axiom**, restricted
  to weak coupling where it is perturbatively controlled).

**Why weak coupling.** `u₄ ≠ 0` is enough for non-triviality (the theory is interacting). For the
fixed quartic, the dimensionless coupling is `g = 1/(4 mass²)`, so `mass > m₀` ⟺ `g < g₀ := 1/(4m₀²)`
— a *finite* upper bound on `g`. In that regime the perturbative leading term `u₄'(0) = −6∫(C_a f)⁴`
strictly dominates the `O(g²)` corrections (Nelson hypercontractivity at fixed volume — no cluster
expansion), so `u₄ < 0`. Strong coupling (small mass, where `φ⁴₂` has a phase transition) is *not*
needed for non-triviality and is left out; `u₄ < 0` still holds there (Lebowitz) but
non-perturbatively.

/-- **Weak-coupling uniform strict negativity of the lattice connected four-point** (the analytic
core, weak-coupling regime).

There is a mass threshold `m₀ > 0` such that for every `mass > m₀` (equivalently, dimensionless
coupling `g = 1/(4 mass²) < 1/(4 m₀²)`) there are a test function `f` and `c > 0` with
`u₄(torusInteractingMeasure L N P mass)(f) ≤ −c` for **all** `N`. I.e. above the threshold the
connected four-point is bounded strictly away from `0` uniformly in the lattice cutoff.

Reference / strategy: the perturbative weak-coupling non-triviality of `φ⁴₂`. Leading term
`u₄'(0) = −4!·(1/4)·∫(C_a f)⁴ = −6∫(C_a f)⁴ < 0` (Wick on the free GFF; `∫(C_a f)⁴ > 0`; the term is
Wick-ordering-invariant — all four legs external). Remainder `|R(g)| ≤ K g²` cutoff-uniform from
Nelson hypercontractivity (`GaussianHilbert.polynomial_chaos_concentration` /
`bonami_nelson_chaosLE` via `Pphi2/NelsonEstimate`; **no cluster expansion at fixed volume `L`**). So
for `g` below the convergence radius `g₀` the leading term dominates and `u₄ ≤ −(κg/2)∫(C f)⁴ < 0`.
