# Jentzsch's Theorem and Kernel Positivity

This file states Jentzsch's theorem (proved in JentzschProof.lean), axiomatizes
kernel positivity facts about the transfer operator, and derives the
Perron-Frobenius properties needed for the P(Φ)₂ construction.

## Theorem: Jentzsch's theorem (Reed-Simon IV, XIII.43–44)

For a compact, self-adjoint, positivity-improving operator T on L² with
eigenbasis indexed by a type with ≥ 2 elements:
- The spectral radius r is a simple eigenvalue with strictly positive value.
- All other eigenvalues λ satisfy |λ| < r.

Proved in `JentzschProof.lean` via the variational absolute value trick.

**Important**: Jentzsch does NOT imply all eigenvalues are positive.
Counterexample: [[1,2],[2,1]] is positivity-improving with eigenvalues 3,-1.

## Axiom 2: Transfer operator positivity-improving

The kernel T(ψ,ψ') = w(ψ)·G(ψ-ψ')·w(ψ') > 0 is strictly positive.

## Axiom 3: Gaussian kernel is strictly positive definite

⟨f, Tf⟩ > 0 for nonzero f, since the Gaussian kernel exp(-½‖·‖²) has
strictly positive Fourier transform (Bochner), and w > 0 preserves this.

## Axiom 4: L²(ℝ^Ns) Hilbert basis nontriviality

Any Hilbert basis of L²(ℝ^Ns) has at least 2 elements.

## Derived theorems

From Jentzsch + axioms 2-4 we derive:
- `transferOperator_inner_nonneg`: ⟨f, Tf⟩ ≥ 0
- `transferOperator_eigenvalues_pos`: all λᵢ > 0
- `transferOperator_ground_simple`: unique leading eigenvalue with strict gap
- `transferOperator_ground_simple_spectral`: packaged spectral data

/-! ## Jentzsch's theorem (proved in JentzschProof.lean) -/

/-- **Jentzsch's theorem** for compact self-adjoint positivity-improving
operators on L²(ℝ^n).

Given a nontrivial eigenbasis (|ι| ≥ 2), there exists a distinguished index
i₀ (ground) such that:
(a) λ(i₀) > 0 (the leading eigenvalue is strictly positive).
(b) λ(i₀) is simple: it is the unique index with this eigenvalue.
(c) |λ(i)| < λ(i₀) for all i ≠ i₀ (strict spectral gap).

Proved in `JentzschProof.lean` via the variational absolute value trick.
The bridge from `IsPositivityImproving` (ae) to `IsPositivityImproving'` (Lp lattice)
is `IsPositivityImproving.toPI'`.

/-! ## Axiom 2: Transfer operator is positivity-improving -/

/-- The transfer operator is positivity-improving.

The kernel `T(ψ,ψ') = exp(-(a/2)h(ψ)) · exp(-½‖ψ-ψ'‖²) · exp(-(a/2)h(ψ')) > 0`
is strictly positive for all ψ, ψ'. For f ≥ 0, f ≠ 0, the set
S = {ψ' : f(ψ') > 0} has positive measure, so
(Tf)(ψ) = ∫ T(ψ,ψ') f(ψ') dψ' ≥ ∫_S T(ψ,ψ') f(ψ') dψ' > 0.

**Proof**: Uses the factorization T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w where w > 0 (exp) and G > 0 (exp).
Multiplication by w > 0 preserves nonneg/nonzero. Convolution with the strictly positive
Gaussian kernel maps nonneg nonzero functions to ae strictly positive functions (by
`integral_pos_iff_support_of_nonneg_ae` and translation invariance of Lebesgue measure).
Final multiplication by w > 0 preserves ae strict positivity. -/

/-! ## Axiom 3: Gaussian convolution is strictly positive definite

The Gaussian kernel G(x) = exp(-½‖x‖²) has Fourier transform
Ĝ(k) = (2π)^{n/2} exp(-½‖k‖²) > 0 everywhere. By Bochner's theorem and
Plancherel, convolution by G is strictly positive definite on L²:

  ⟨f, Conv_G f⟩ = ∫ |f̂(k)|² Ĝ(k) dk > 0  for f ≠ 0.

This is the bridge axiom from the [bochner](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/bochner)
formalization project. -/

/-- Convolution with the Gaussian kernel is strictly positive definite on L².

**Proof**: Factored through the square-root Gaussian H(x) = exp(-‖x‖²):
  ⟨f, Conv_G f⟩ = C · ‖Conv_H f‖²
where C > 0 (from the Gaussian convolution identity G = C⁻¹ · H⋆H),
and Conv_H is injective (since Ĥ > 0 everywhere). See `GaussianFourier.lean`. -/

      0 < @inner ℝ _ _ g (convCLM (transferGaussian Ns) (transferGaussian_memLp Ns) g) :=
  gaussian_conv_strictlyPD Ns

/-! ## Derived: Transfer operator strictly positive definite

From the factorization T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w with M_w self-adjoint:
  ⟨f, Tf⟩ = ⟨M_w f, Conv_G(M_w f)⟩ > 0
since w > 0 makes M_w injective (f ≠ 0 → M_w f ≠ 0) and Conv_G is
strictly PD by the axiom above. -/

/-- The transfer operator is strictly positive definite: ⟨f, Tf⟩ > 0 for
all nonzero f ∈ L².

**Proof**: Uses self-adjointness of M_w to rewrite
⟨f, M_w(Conv_G(M_w f))⟩ = ⟨M_w f, Conv_G(M_w f)⟩,
injectivity of M_w (from w > 0) to show M_w f ≠ 0,
and the Gaussian convolution strict PD axiom. -/

/-! ## Derived theorems

We now derive the Perron-Frobenius properties of the transfer
operator from the axioms above. These have the same signatures as the
former axioms in L2Operator.lean, ensuring downstream compatibility. -/

and ⟨0, T0⟩ = 0 for f = 0). -/

/-- All eigenvalues of the transfer operator are strictly positive.

Proof: ⟨bᵢ, T(bᵢ)⟩ = λᵢ · ‖bᵢ‖² = λᵢ > 0 by strict positive definiteness,
since bᵢ ≠ 0 (it has norm 1). -/

nontriviality (to pick some i₁ ≠ i₀) and eigenvalue positivity
