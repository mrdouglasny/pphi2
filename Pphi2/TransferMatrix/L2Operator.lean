# Transfer Matrix as L² Operator

Formalizes the transfer matrix as a bounded linear operator on L²(ℝ^Ns)
and connects it to the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators.

## Main definitions

- `L2SpatialField Ns` — The Hilbert space L²(ℝ^Ns) where the transfer operator acts
- `transferOperatorCLM` — The transfer matrix as a CLM on L², defined via the
  kernel factorization T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w
- `transferOperator_spectral` — Spectral decomposition from gaussian-field's
  `compact_selfAdjoint_spectral`

## Construction

The transfer kernel factors as:
  `T(ψ, ψ') = w(ψ) · G(ψ - ψ') · w(ψ')`
where:
- `w(ψ) = exp(-(a/2) · h(ψ))` is the weight (bounded, from spatial action)
- `G(x) = exp(-timeCoupling(0, x))` is the Gaussian kernel (in L¹)

This gives `T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w` where:
- `M_w` is multiplication by `w` (a CLM on L² by Hölder, from L2Multiplication.lean)
- `Conv_G` is convolution with `G` (a CLM on L² by Young, from L2Convolution.lean)

/-! ## L² Hilbert space

The transfer operator acts on L²(ℝ^Ns, dx) where ℝ^Ns = SpatialField Ns
and dx is Lebesgue measure (product of 1D Lebesgue measures). -/

/-- The L² Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the spatial field
configuration space ℝ^Ns.

This is the natural Hilbert space for the transfer matrix formalism:
the transfer kernel T(ψ,ψ') defines an integral operator on this space. -/

The building blocks for the kernel factorization T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w. -/

/-- The weight function `w(ψ) = exp(-(a/2) · h(ψ))` where `h` is the spatial action.

This is bounded above by `exp(a · Ns · A / 2)` where `A` is the lower bound
constant from `wickPolynomial_bounded_below`, since:
- `spatialKinetic ≥ 0` (sum of squares)
- `spatialPotential ≥ -Ns · A` (from Wick polynomial bound below)
- Therefore `h(ψ) ≥ -Ns · A`, so `w(ψ) ≤ exp(a · Ns · A / 2)`. -/

/-! ## Transfer operator definition

The transfer operator is defined as `T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w`, where
`M_w` is multiplication by the weight and `Conv_G` is Gaussian convolution.

This replaces the previous axiom `transferOperatorCLM` with a definition,
eliminating one axiom from the proof. -/

/-- The transfer matrix as a continuous linear map on L²(ℝ^Ns).

Defined via the kernel factorization:
  `T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w`
where `w(ψ) = exp(-(a/2)·h(ψ))` and `G(x) = exp(-½‖x‖²)`.

This factors the transfer kernel as:
  `T(ψ,ψ') = w(ψ) · G(ψ-ψ') · w(ψ')`
           `= exp(-(a/2)h(ψ)) · exp(-½‖ψ-ψ'‖²) · exp(-(a/2)h(ψ'))`
           `= exp(-timeCoupling(ψ,ψ') - (a/2)h(ψ) - (a/2)h(ψ'))` -/

/-! ## Properties of the transfer operator -/

/-- The transfer operator is self-adjoint on L²(ℝ^Ns).

This follows from the factorization `T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w` and the
self-adjointness of each factor:
- `M_w` is self-adjoint (since `w` is real-valued)
- `Conv_G` is self-adjoint (since the Gaussian is symmetric: `G(x) = G(-x)`)

Then: `⟨f, Tg⟩ = ⟨f, M_w(Conv_G(M_w g))⟩`
    `= ⟨M_w f, Conv_G(M_w g)⟩`     (M_w self-adjoint)
    `= ⟨Conv_G(M_w f), M_w g⟩`     (Conv_G self-adjoint)
    `= ⟨M_w(Conv_G(M_w f)), g⟩`    (M_w self-adjoint)
    `= ⟨Tf, g⟩`.

**Proof strategy**: Prove self-adjointness of `mulCLM` (from real-valuedness
of `w` and the L² inner product) and of `convCLM` (from symmetry of the
Gaussian kernel), then compose. -/

/-- Hilbert-Schmidt operators are compact: if `w ∈ L² ∩ L∞` and `g ∈ L¹` with
`‖g‖_∞ ≤ 1`, then `M_w ∘ Conv_g ∘ M_w` is compact on `L²`.

**Proof**: Factor as `(M_w ∘ Conv_g) ∘ M_w`. The operator `M_w ∘ Conv_g` has
convolution kernel `K(x,t) = w(x) · g(t)` with `K ∈ L²(μ ⊗ μ)` (tensor product
of L² functions), so it is Hilbert-Schmidt, hence compact by
`integral_operator_l2_kernel_compact`. The final `M_w` factor is a bounded CLM,
so the composition is compact by `IsCompactOperator.comp_clm`.

/-- The transfer operator is compact on L²(ℝ^Ns).

**Proof**: Apply `hilbert_schmidt_isCompact` to the factorization
`T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w`. Hilbert-Schmidt compactness is used only on the
inner pair `M_w ∘ Conv_G`, whose convolution kernel `K(x,t) = w(x) · G(t)`
lies in `L²(μ ⊗ μ)` because `w ∈ L²` (from Gaussian decay,
`transferWeight_memLp_two`) and `G ∈ L¹` with `‖G‖_∞ ≤ 1` — so
`‖K‖²_{L²(μ⊗μ)} = ‖w‖²₂ · ‖G‖²₂ ≤ ‖w‖²₂ · ‖G‖₁ < ∞`. The right-hand
`M_w` factor is then composed in as a bounded CLM, preserving compactness.

(Hilbert-Schmidt compactness applied directly to the full kernel
`K(ψ,ψ') = w(ψ) G(ψ-ψ') w(ψ')` would also work, but routing through the
inner pair is what `hilbert_schmidt_isCompact` actually does and avoids
re-proving the L² product bound for the full kernel.)

Hypotheses verified for `hilbert_schmidt_isCompact`:
- `w = transferWeight` is measurable, essentially bounded, and in L²
- `G = transferGaussian` is in L¹ and satisfies `‖G‖_∞ ≤ 1` -/

gaussian-field's `SpectralTheorem.lean`), the transfer operator has a
Hilbert basis of eigenvectors with real eigenvalues. -/

/-! ## Perron-Frobenius facts on spectral data

The Perron-Frobenius properties (eigenvalue positivity, ground-state simplicity,
spectral gap) are derived from Jentzsch's theorem in `Jentzsch.lean`.
The names `transferOperator_eigenvalues_pos`, `transferOperator_ground_simple`,
`transferOperator_inner_nonneg`, and `transferOperator_ground_simple_spectral`
are defined there with the same signatures as the former axioms here. -/
